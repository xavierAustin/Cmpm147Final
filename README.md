# Cmpm147Final
## Summary:
An iterative platformer with randomly generated levels. The levels are generated using chunks of various widths with tiles generated within those chunks. These tiles can either be semi-randomly placed, with various constraints for playability, or randomly selected from predesigned mappings which are modified randomly. 
## Theoretical analysis:
This project looked at the developing concepts of PCGs in game development. As these practices become more commonplace we ask ourselves if/when these kinds of PCGs will push people out of the game industry. Level design is one of the most important features of any kind of platformer and aims to make each level beatable, enjoyable, and if possible, replayable. So if level design is put into the “hands” of PCGs such as ours, should level designers be concerned about a tool turning into a replacement? Using strategies from the readings Design Metaphors for Procedural Content Generation in Games (Reading 04)– specifically PSG as a designer and Level Design II: Handcrafted Integration (Reading 09), we juxtapose the algorithmically created portions of the level with randomly generated portions. In doing so we put a critical lens on the feasibility of utilizing PCG as a replacement for real designers.
